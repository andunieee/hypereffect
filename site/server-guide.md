## Mental model

- The **server** owns all application state and decides what the interface
  is. The **renderer** knows nothing about the app: it draws elements with
  native widgets, evaluates expressions, and sends actions back.
- The interface is a **tree of elements** (instances of 18 fixed components)
  plus a **signals** object (shared JSON state). Element attributes can be
  [CEL](https://cel.dev) expressions over the signals, recomputed by the
  renderer whenever what they read changes.
- The server updates the interface by sending, at any time, any number of:
  - `element`: create, replace or move one element,
  - `remove`: delete one element and its subtree,
  - `signal`: a JSON Merge Patch (RFC 7386) on the signals,
  - `metadata`: optional app name, description and icon.
- The renderer sends `hello` once, then `action` messages when the user
  triggers a handler. Each action carries all non-local signals.

**Design rule: build the tree once, then change as little as possible.**
Prefer, in this order:

1. **No message at all.** UI-only state (filters, open dialogs, tab choice,
   "editing" mode) lives in *local signals* (`_`-prefixed), written by handler
   `patch`es and read by expressions. No round trip.
2. **A `signal` patch.** Data the server changes (counts, statuses, progress,
   flags, per-item values) goes in signals; attributes that depend on it are
   expressions. A patch is tiny and touches only what it names.
3. **Re-sending one `element`.** Only when a *literal* attribute must change
   or an element must move. Same `id` and `type` keeps widget state (focus,
   cursor, scroll).
4. **Adding / removing elements.** Only when the set of things on screen
   changes (an item is added or deleted).

Never rebuild the interface from scratch to apply a change, and never
`remove` then re-add an element to update it: that destroys focus and
widget state, and costs bandwidth.

## Wire format

Newline-delimited UTF-8 lines: `tag SP json-object LF`. Example session:

```
renderer → server
hello {}

server → renderer
signal {"count":0}
element {"id":"main","type":"column"}
element {"id":"value","type":"text","parent":"main","text":{"cel":"'Count: ' + string(s.count)"}}
element {"id":"inc","type":"button","parent":"main","label":"+","onPress":{"action":"add"}}

renderer → server
action {"name":"add","signals":{"count":0}}

server → renderer
signal {"count":1}
```

## Messages → Rust

Imports used everywhere:

```rust
use hypereffect::ui::*; // column, row, card, list, tabs, tab, dialog, text, notice,
                        // badge, image, divider, progress, button, input, checkbox,
                        // select, slider
use hypereffect::{cel, json, Action, App, Element, Handler, Map, Metadata, Outbox, Value};
use std::collections::BTreeMap;
```

### The `App` trait

One `App` value exists per session. It is created with `Default` on every
`hello` and dropped when the session ends.

```rust
pub trait App {
    fn hello(&mut self, out: &mut Outbox, params: &BTreeMap<String, String>);
    fn action(&mut self, out: &mut Outbox, action: &Action);
    fn tick(&mut self, _out: &mut Outbox, _now_ms: f64) {}       // optional timer
    fn tick_interval(&self) -> Option<u32> { None }               // ms, or no timer
}
```

Everything you write to the `Outbox` during one call is sent as one batch,
in order. Renderers process a batch before redrawing, so a batch is
effectively atomic for the user.

`Server<A>` drives an `App` from raw bytes (`receive`, `tick`, `output()`);
`hypereffect::wasm_app!(MyApp)` exports one from a wasm module. Any
transport that carries lines works (stdio, TCP, WebSocket, SSE+POST).

### `element` → `out.element(...)`

| Wire | Rust |
| --- | --- |
| `{"id":"x","type":"button"}` | `button("x")` (or `Element::new("x", Component::Button)`) |
| `"parent":"p"` | `.parent("p")` |
| `"before":"y"` | `.before("y")` |
| `"label":"Save"` | `.label("Save")` |
| `"label":{"cel":"..."}` | `.label(cel("..."))` |
| `"bind":"form.email"` | `.bind("form.email")` |
| `"onPress":{"action":"save"}` | `.on_press(Handler::action("save"))` |
| any other attribute | `.set("name", value)` |

Attribute setters: `visible disabled gap align justify wrap title empty label
open value variant src alt placeholder error options min max step text`.
Each takes a literal (`&str`, `bool`, number, `json!(...)`) or `cel("...")`.
Handler setters: `on_press on_change on_submit on_dismiss`.

**`id`, `type`, `parent`, `before`, `bind` and handlers are structural: they
must be literals, never `cel(...)`.**

What the renderer does with an `element` message:

- **Unknown id → insert** under `parent` (or the root), before the sibling
  named by `before`, else appended. The parent must already exist: send
  parents before children.
- **Known id → replace.** *All* attributes are replaced; omitted ones reset to
  defaults. It is not a merge. If `type` is unchanged the element keeps its
  children and widget state. If `type` changed, its children are dropped.
- **Move:** re-send with a different `parent`, or with `before` naming a
  sibling. Children move along.

Because replacement is total, write **one builder function per element**
(or per element kind) and use it both to create and to re-send. Then a
re-send cannot accidentally drop an attribute.

### `remove` → `out.remove("id")`

Removes the element and its whole subtree. Removing a non-existent id is a
no-op. Ids can be reused afterwards.

### `signal` → `out.signal(json!({...}))`

A JSON Merge Patch over the signals:

- objects merge recursively: `{"user":{"name":"Ada"}}` changes only
  `user.name`;
- `null` **deletes** a key (so you cannot store `null`; use `""`, `false`
  or `0` as the empty value);
- any other value, **including arrays**, replaces the old value wholesale.

Consequence: keep per-item state in **objects keyed by item id**
(`{"done":{"t1":true,"t2":false}}`), not arrays. Then one item can be
patched (`{"done":{"t2":true}}`) or deleted (`{"done":{"t2":null}}`) alone.

The argument must be a JSON object (it panics otherwise). For dynamic keys
use `json!({ "done": { &id: true } })`, or build a `Map<String, Value>`.

Local signals: any key starting with `_`, at any depth. The renderer never
sends them back to the server; the server may still write them (for example
to reset an indicator or close a dialog).

### `metadata` → `out.metadata(Metadata::new().name("Tasks"))`

Optional: `name`, `description`, `icon` (URL). Each message replaces the
previous one. Renderers may ignore it.

### `hello` → `App::hello(out, params)`

`params` are string key/values chosen by whoever opened the session (for
example from a URL). They are user input. The session starts with no
elements and signals `{}`. Build the initial interface here: **signals
first** (so expressions have something to read), then elements, parents
before children.

### `action` → `App::action(out, action)`

```rust
pub struct Action {
    pub name: String,                  // the handler's action name
    pub payload: Option<Value>,        // the handler's payload, verbatim
    pub signals: Map<String, Value>,   // all non-local signals at send time
}
action.payload_as::<String>()          // Option<T>: typed payload
action.signal("form.email")            // Option<&Value>: signal by path
```

Everything in an action is untrusted user input: validate the name, the
payload (an id in a payload does not prove the user was shown that item),
and every signal you read. Reply with signals/elements; there is no error
message type. Show errors with ordinary UI (`notice`, an input's `error`).

### Handlers

```rust
Handler::action("save")                          // {"action":"save"}
Handler::action("delete").payload("t3")          // payload: any JSON
Handler::action("login").indicator("_busy")      // sets s._busy = true when sent
Handler::patch(json!({ "_open": true }))         // local only, no round trip
Handler::patch(json!({ "_open": cel("!s._open") }))   // patch leaves may be CEL
Handler::action("clear").with_patch(json!({ "_confirm": false }))  // patch, then send
```

When triggered, the renderer: stops if the element or an ancestor is
disabled or hidden; applies `patch`; sets `indicator` to `true`; sends the
action. **The renderer never clears an indicator: the server must reset it
in every reply, including early-return and error paths**
(`out.signal(json!({ "_busy": false }))`).

### Binding

`bind: "a.b"` makes a control read and write `s.a.b`: `input` (string; number
or null for `variant: "number"`), `checkbox` (bool), `select` (option value
string), `slider` (number), `tabs` (selected tab id). User edits are applied
locally and immediately; the server sees them in the `signals` of the next
action. Add `on_change(Handler::action(...))` if the server must react to
each change. If the server writes a bound path, the control shows the new
value even while focused.

`bind` suits drafts and inputs (form fields, a search box, a setting the
server reads on the next submit) as they are. A bound control whose change
the server must confirm needs the extra care described in the next section.

## Server-confirmed state

When an action needs the server to say whether it happened (persisting a
change, switching a device, anything that can fail or be refused), the
server's reply is the only truth. The client may show that a request is in
flight, but **never present an unconfirmed value as settled**. There are two
ways to do it, depending on the control.

### Pattern A: request without touching the value

For buttons, badges and text, whose look is computed from the value, the
client never writes the value at all. Use two signals: the value
(server-owned) and a local loading flag (an indicator, so it must start with
`_`). Starting from off:

```
signals        {"value":false,"_loading":false}

user clicks →  renderer sets _loading = true (indicator), value untouched
renderer →     action {"name":"toggled","payload":true,"signals":{"value":false}}
server →       signal {"_loading":false,"value":true}
```

Until the reply the switch still reads "off", shown as busy and disabled.
If the server refuses, it replies `{"_loading":false,"value":false}` (plus an
error to show): nothing has to be rolled back, and nothing ever showed a
state that was not true.

Rules:

- No handler `patch` writes the value.
- Request with `Handler::action(...).indicator("_loading")`; disable the
  control and show progress with expressions over `s._loading`.
- Let the payload name the **wanted** state (`true`/`false`), not "flip",
  so a duplicated request is harmless. A payload is a literal, so use one
  control per possible request and pick the visible one with an expression
  over the value. (Re-sending the element with a new payload after each
  change also works.)
- Reply with the confirmed value **and** the loading reset in one patch, on
  every path, including refusals.

A complete switch:

```rust
use hypereffect::ui::*;
use hypereffect::{cel, json, Action, App, Handler, Outbox};
use std::collections::BTreeMap;

#[derive(Default)]
pub struct Lamp {
    on: bool,
}

impl App for Lamp {
    fn hello(&mut self, out: &mut Outbox, _: &BTreeMap<String, String>) {
        // `value` is the server's truth. `_loading` is local: an indicator
        // path must start with `_`, and the server has no use for it.
        out.signal(json!({ "value": self.on, "_loading": false }));
        out.element(row("lamp").justify("between"));
        out.element(text("lamp-name").parent("lamp").text("Porch light"));
        out.element(
            badge("lamp-state")
                .parent("lamp")
                .text(cel("s._loading ? '…' : s.value ? 'On' : 'Off'"))
                .variant(cel("s.value ? 'success' : 'neutral'")),
        );
        // A payload is a literal, so the two possible requests are two
        // buttons, and the value decides which one is shown.
        for (id, label, target) in [("turn-on", "Turn on", true), ("turn-off", "Turn off", false)] {
            out.element(
                button(id)
                    .parent("lamp")
                    .label(label)
                    .visible(cel(if target { "!s.value" } else { "s.value" }))
                    .disabled(cel("s._loading"))
                    .on_press(Handler::action("toggled").payload(target).indicator("_loading")),
            );
        }
    }

    fn action(&mut self, out: &mut Outbox, action: &Action) {
        if action.name != "toggled" {
            return;
        }
        // The payload names the wanted state, so a repeated request is
        // harmless. If the change fails, reply with the old value, an error
        // to show, and still the indicator reset.
        if let Some(want) = action.payload_as::<bool>() {
            self.on = want;
        }
        out.signal(json!({ "_loading": false, "value": self.on }));
    }
}
```

### Pattern B: bound controls (optimistic, pending, corrected)

`checkbox`, `select`, `slider` and `tabs` show their value only through
`bind`, and a user change writes the bound path before any handler runs. So
the click necessarily shows the requested value early. That is fine as long
as it is visibly a request: marked pending and disabled until the server
answers with the real value, which the control then shows (a control always
shows a value the server writes to its bound path, even while focused).

Keep the value and a local flag together, `{"auto":{"value":false,"_loading":false}}`.
Starting from off:

```
user clicks →  bind writes auto.value = true; onChange's patch sets auto._loading = true
renderer →     action {"name":"auto","signals":{"auto":{"value":true},"error":""}}
server →       signal {"auto":{"value":true,"_loading":false},"error":""}                                (success)
server →       signal {"auto":{"value":false,"_loading":false},"error":"Could not change auto-update."}  (failure: the box flips back)
```

```rust
#[derive(Default)]
struct Settings {
    auto: bool,
}

/// The real side effect: a database write, a device call. It may fail.
fn apply_auto_update(on: bool) -> Result<(), String> {
    let _ = on;
    Ok(())
}

impl App for Settings {
    fn hello(&mut self, out: &mut Outbox, _: &BTreeMap<String, String>) {
        out.signal(json!({ "auto": { "value": self.auto, "_loading": false }, "error": "" }));
        out.element(
            checkbox("auto")
                .label(cel("s.auto._loading ? 'Auto-update (saving…)' : 'Auto-update'"))
                .bind("auto.value")
                .disabled(cel("s.auto._loading"))
                // `auto._loading` is local (a `_` key at any depth) but cannot be
                // an indicator, whose first segment must start with `_`: set it
                // with a patch, which runs before the action is sent.
                .on_change(Handler::action("auto").with_patch(json!({ "auto": { "_loading": true } }))),
        );
        out.element(notice("error").variant("failure").text(cel("s.error")).visible(cel("s.error != ''")));
    }

    fn action(&mut self, out: &mut Outbox, action: &Action) {
        if action.name != "auto" {
            return;
        }
        // The bound value in this action is the request, not the truth.
        let err = match action.signal("auto.value").and_then(Value::as_bool) {
            Some(want) if apply_auto_update(want).is_ok() => {
                self.auto = want;
                ""
            }
            _ => "Could not change auto-update.",
        };
        // Always answer with the server's own value: this confirms or rolls back.
        out.signal(json!({ "auto": { "value": self.auto, "_loading": false }, "error": err }));
    }
}
```

Rules:

- Disable the control while pending (handlers of disabled controls do not
  run, so no second request can start) and say so in its label or nearby.
- Read the bound value in the action as the requested state; validate it.
- Reply on every path with the server's own value and the pending flag
  reset. Without that echo a refused change would stay on screen.
- Keep the server's state as the source of truth. While a request is
  pending, *other* actions also carry the unconfirmed value in their signals:
  never take it from there.
- If the connection drops before the reply, the box stays flipped and
  pending; the renderer disables everything, and the next `hello` rebuilds
  from the server's state.

Prefer pattern A when even a brief wrong value is unacceptable (a payment,
a door lock), and pattern B when the native control matters more.

**The mistake** both patterns avoid is a bound control or a patch that writes
the value with no pending state and no authoritative reply:

```rust
// ANTI-PATTERN: looks done the moment it is clicked, stays enabled, and
// nothing corrects it if the server refuses.
checkbox("lamp").bind("value").on_change(Handler::action("toggled"));
button("lamp").on_press(Handler::action("toggled").with_patch(json!({ "value": cel("!s.value") })));
```

## Components

A summary. The full reference, with every attribute's notes and examples, is
[components.md](https://hypereffect.dev/components.md).

Containers (accept children): `column`, `row`, `card`, `list`, `tab`,
`dialog`. `tabs` accepts only `tab`. `tab` goes only in `tabs`. `dialog` goes
only at the root (shown as an overlay). Everything else is a leaf.

All components have `visible` (bool, default true). Controls (`button`,
`input`, `checkbox`, `select`, `slider`) also have `disabled`.

| Component | Attributes (default) |
| --- | --- |
| `column` | `gap` none/small/**medium**/large, `align` start/center/end/**stretch** |
| `row` | `gap` (**small**), `align` (**center**), `justify` **start**/center/end/between, `wrap` (false) |
| `card` | `title`, `gap` (medium) |
| `list` | `empty` (text shown when it has no visible children) |
| `tabs` | `bind` (selected tab id), `onChange` |
| `tab` | `label` (defaults to the id), `gap` |
| `dialog` | `open` (true), `title`, `onDismiss` |
| `text` | `text`, `variant` h1/h2/h3/**body**/caption/code |
| `notice` | `title`, `text`, `variant` **info**/success/warning/failure |
| `badge` | `text`, `variant` **neutral**/info/success/warning/failure |
| `image` | `src`, `alt`, `variant` **inline**/thumbnail/avatar/full |
| `divider` | — |
| `progress` | `value` 0..1 or null (indeterminate), `label`, `variant` **bar**/spinner |
| `button` | `label`, `variant` primary/**secondary**/plain/success/failure, `onPress` |
| `input` | `bind`, `label`, `placeholder`, `error` (non-empty shows it), `variant` **text**/multiline/password/number/email, `onChange`, `onSubmit` |
| `checkbox` | `bind`, `label`, `variant` **checkbox**/switch, `onChange` |
| `select` | `bind`, `label`, `options` `[{"value":..,"label":..}]`, `variant` **dropdown**/radio/segmented, `onChange` |
| `slider` | `bind`, `label`, `min` (0), `max` (100), `step` (1), `onChange` |

Variants are semantic, never colours or sizes: the renderer chooses the look.
Unknown enum values fall back to the default.

## Expressions (CEL)

- One variable, `s`, holds the signals: `s.count`, `s.user.name`,
  `s.done['t1']`, `s.done[k]`.
- Standard CEL plus the strings extension: `size`, `in`, `has()`,
  `.exists()`, `.all()`, `.filter()`, `.map()`, `string()`, `int()`,
  `double()`, `.trim()`, `.contains()`, `.format([...])`, map literals, `?:`.
- Results are type-checked: string attributes need a string (no implicit
  conversion: `'n = ' + string(s.n)`), bool attributes need a bool.
- Ints and doubles do not mix in arithmetic. Serialize numbers consistently
  (`0.0` vs `0`), or convert with `double()`.
- A failing expression (missing signal, wrong type) silently yields the
  attribute's default. Initialise every signal an expression reads before,
  or in the same batch as, the element that reads it.
- Formatting ids into expressions (`format!("s._editing == '{id}'")`) is
  fine when ids are server-generated and safe. Never interpolate
  user-supplied text into CEL; put it in a signal and read the signal.
- Lookup tables for variants: `{'ok':'success','bad':'failure'}[s.status]`.

## Ids

Ids are global across the tree, not per parent. Derive them from domain ids
and suffix children: row `t3`, its title `t3-text`, its button
`t3-del`. Stable ids are what make fine-grained updates possible.

## Example 1: a task list with fine-grained element updates

Every operation sends the minimum:

| User does | Server sends |
| --- | --- |
| adds a task | 1 `signal` (new task's state) + the new row and its 5 children, inserted with `before` at the top |
| marks a task done | the renderer only sets `_pending.<id>` (button disabled); the server flips its own state and replies with 1 `signal`: the confirmed `done.<id>` and the indicator reset |
| edits a title | the edit mode toggle is a local patch (no traffic); on submit, 1 re-sent `text` element (new literal) + 1 `signal` |
| moves a task up | 1 re-sent `row` with `before` (children move along) + 1 `signal` |
| deletes a task | 1 `remove` (takes the subtree) + 1 `signal` with `null`s |
| any of the above | the "N of M left" caption and the ↑ buttons' `disabled` update by themselves: they are expressions |

Note that `_editing`, `_adding` and `_pending` never appear in the actions:
they are local. And `done.t1` is still `false` in the `toggle` action: the
renderer did not touch it, the server's reply set it.

## Example 2: a live pipeline driven only by signals

The whole interface is sent once in `hello`. After that the server sends
**only `signal` messages**, from actions and from a 100 ms timer. Every
attribute that changes (progress, badge text and colour, button label and
state, the result notice) is an expression over the signals.

Wire traffic (the user checked "Make the tests fail", then pressed Run):

```
> action {"name":"start","signals":{"status":"idle","run":0,"fail":true,"stages":{"build":{"state":"pending","pct":0.0},"test":{"state":"pending","pct":0.0},"deploy":{"state":"pending","pct":0.0}}}}
signal {"status":"running","run":1,"_starting":false,"stages":{"build":{"state":"pending","pct":0.0},"test":{"state":"pending","pct":0.0},"deploy":{"state":"pending","pct":0.0}}}
signal {"stages":{"build":{"state":"running"}}}

tick: signal {"stages":{"build":{"pct":0.1}}}
…
tick: signal {"stages":{"build":{"pct":0.9}}}
tick: signal {"stages":{"build":{"state":"passed","pct":1.0},"test":{"state":"running"}}}
tick: signal {"stages":{"test":{"pct":0.125}}}
…
tick: signal {"status":"failed","stages":{"test":{"state":"failed"},"deploy":{"state":"skipped"}}}
```

Each tick patches a single number deep inside `stages`; the renderer
re-evaluates only the expressions that read it.

When a set of *things* changes over time (rows in a log, new items), signals
alone cannot create elements: there is no templating. Add and remove those
elements individually, as in example 1, and keep their changing values in
signals keyed by id.

## Testing

With the `client` feature, `hypereffect::server::Loopback` runs a real
renderer core (element tree, signals, CEL) against your `App` in-process:

```rust
use hypereffect::{json, server::Loopback};

#[test]
fn add_and_toggle() {
    let mut l = Loopback::<Todos>::new();          // sends hello
    l.write("new", json!("Buy milk"));             // like typing into a bound input
    assert!(l.trigger("add", "onPress"));          // true if an action was sent
    assert_eq!(l.client.children(Some("items")), ["t1"]);
    assert!(l.trigger("t1-done", "onPress"));
    assert_eq!(l.client.attr("left", "text"), Some(json!("0 of 1 left")));
    assert!(l.client.take_diagnostics().is_empty()); // no rejected elements or failed CEL

`l.tick(now_ms)` runs the timer; `l.client.value(path)` reads a signal;
`l.client.attr(id, name)` reads a resolved attribute. Always assert
`take_diagnostics()` is empty: it catches wrong nesting, missing parents,
CEL type errors and failing expressions.

## Checklist

- Signals before the elements that read them; parents before children.
- Every signal an expression reads is initialised (no `null`: it deletes).
- Per-item state in id-keyed objects, never arrays.
- One builder per element; re-sends reuse it (replacement is not a merge).
- Update with `signal` when possible, re-send one element when a literal or
  position changes, `remove` only to delete. Never rebuild.
- UI-only state in `_` local signals, changed by handler patches.
- Server-confirmed state is never presented as settled before the reply:
  either the client does not write it (pattern A: action plus indicator), or
  a bound control shows it as pending and disabled until the server answers
  with the real value (pattern B). Every reply resets the pending flag and
  carries the server's value.
- Every action reply resets the indicators it may have set, on all paths.
- Validate every action name, payload and signal read.
- No user text inside CEL strings; no `cel(...)` in structural attributes.
- `dialog` only at the root, `tab` only in `tabs`.
